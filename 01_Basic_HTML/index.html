                        New research from scientists at McMaster University 
                        reveals exercise-related testosterone and growth 
                        hormone do not play an influential role in building 
                        muscle after weightlifting, despite conventional 
                        wisdom suggesting otherwise.</p>

                        An evaluation of national data by UC Davis researchers 
                        has found that extra weight is not necessarily linked 
                        with a higher risk of death.

                        A*STAR scientists from the Institute of Molecular and 
                        Cell Biology (IMCB) and the Singapore Bioimaging 
                        Consortium (SBIC) have discovered a new signalling 
                        pathway that controls both obesity and atherosclerosis. 
                        The team demonstrated, for the first time, that mice 
                        deficient in the Wip1 gene were resistant to weight 
                        gain and atherosclerosis via regulation of the Ataxia 
                        telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) and its downstream 
                        signalling molecule mTor. These groundbreaking findings 
                        were published in the journal Cell Metabolism on 3rd 
                        July and may provide significant new avenues for 
                        therapeutic interventions for obesity and 
                        atherosclerosis.
